## Split a Bill (React/Redux)

### *This project is  in progress*

It is often difficult to split a check/bill among a group of people, where everyone is paying for a different part of the check/bill (especially tax, tips, and other additional fees). In collaboration with a designer and a developer, we're developing a tool to automate the calculation of how much each person has to pay, making it easier and quicker for people to split their bills/checks for dining, groceries, etc.

What I'm using:
* React 16
* Redux
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML 5
* CSS 3 w/ mobile-first approach
* Webpack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
